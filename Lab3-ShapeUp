Shape Up

The things that I like about Shape Up are

1. The focus on on organizing yourself and being your own manager.
2. They give you 6 weeks to work on something which is a fair amount of time

The things that I don't like about Shape Up are

1. The terminology, they try to sound cool and fresh by using different terms to make things sound exciting but it just makes things needlessly confusing.
2. The diagrams, they look like they get messy fast.

Some questions I had about Shape Up are

1. Why is everything expected to take 6 weeks, seems a bit random.
2. It doesn't seem that there's much of a development roadmap past 6 weeks, how do you estimate how long a software project is going to take?
